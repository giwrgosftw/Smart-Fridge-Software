# Smart-Fridge-Software 2018 (University Project in Software Engineering and Object-Oriented Analysis Design module)
**School of Computer Science (BSc) - City University of London 2017-2018**

In 2018, Ι was a member of a team working on SFXfridge subsystem and my role was to prepare UML Diagrams for the SFXfridge software.
“Smart Fridges” provide the normal functionality of a fridge (such as temperature control) together with extra features, such as food inventory and internet shopping.
The software system is called SmartFridgeX and is divided into two main subsystems, one deployed on the fridge (called SFXfridge) and the other one a mobile app (SFXapp). The diagrams were designed using the Visual Paradigm tool. In addition, more information about the case study and feedback is provided in pdf format.
